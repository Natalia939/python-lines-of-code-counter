# 🧮 Python Lines of Code Counter

A simple yet powerful Python utility that counts the number of **actual lines of code** in a Python file — ignoring blank lines and comments.  
This project demonstrates a clean approach to file handling, command-line argument validation, and logic implementation in Python.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This program, **`lines.py`**, helps you understand how to:
- Work with **command-line arguments**
- Handle **file input/output (I/O)**
- Process and clean text using **string methods**
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable Python code

It’s a great example of small, functional, and testable code — ideal for showcasing your Python fundamentals.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Counts only **real lines of code**
- 🚫 Ignores comments (`#`) and blank lines
- 🧠 Validates input arguments for correctness
- 📂 Ensures input is a valid `.py` file
- ⚠️ Gracefully handles errors (missing file, wrong format, etc.)
- 🧾 Outputs a clear, single count of code lines

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- Built-in modules only (`sys` and `os`)

No external dependencies required.
